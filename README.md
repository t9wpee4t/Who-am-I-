# Who-am-I-
Short introduction of my myself in CS.
As a newcomer to cybersecurity, I bring a flexible approach to problem-solving, combined with a commitment to efficient time management. I am fascinated about the chance to work with technology and safe date. Furthermore eager to seek knowledge into programming languages and how this can be used to protect these sensitive data.
